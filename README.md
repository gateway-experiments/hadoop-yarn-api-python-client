## Compatibility
Library is compatible with Apache Hadoop __**3.2.1**__.  

If u have version other than mentioned (or vendored variant like Hortonworks), certain APIs might be not working or have differences in
implementation. If u plan to use certain API long-term, you might want to make sure its not in Alpha stage in documentation.

## Installation

From PyPI
```
pip install yarn-api-client
```

From Anaconda (conda forge)
```
conda install -c conda-forge yarn-api-client
```

From source code
```
git clone https://github.com/toidi/hadoop-yarn-api-python-client.git
pushd hadoop-yarn-api-python-client
python setup.py install
popd
```

## Enabling support for Kerberos/SPNEGO Security
1. First option - using `requests_kerberos` package  

To avoid deployment issues on a non Kerberized environment, the `requests_kerberos`
dependency is optional and needs to be explicit installed in order to enable access
to YARN console protected by Kerberos/SPNEGO.

`pip install requests_kerberos`

From python code
```
from yarn_api_client.history_server import HistoryServer
from requests_kerberos import HTTPKerberosAuth
history_server = HistoryServer('https://127.0.0.2:5678', auth=HTTPKerberosAuth())
```

PS: You __**need**__ to get valid kerberos ticket in systemwide kerberos cache before running your code, otherwise calls to kerberized environment won't go through (run kinit before proceeding to run code)

2. Second option - using `gssapi` package  

If you want to avoid using terminal calls, you have to perform SPNEGO handshake to retrieve ticket yourself. Full API documentation: https://pythongssapi.github.io/python-gssapi/latest/

# Usage

### CLI interface

1. First way
```
bin/yarn_client --help
```

2. Alternative way
```
python -m yarn_api_client --help
```

### Programmatic interface

```
from yarn_api_client import ApplicationMaster, HistoryServer, NodeManager, ResourceManager
am = ApplicationMaster('https://127.0.0.2:5678')
app_information = am.application_information('application_id')
```

### Changelog

1.0.1 Release
   - Passes the authorization instance to the Active RM check
   - Establishes a new (working) documentation site in readthedocs.io: yarn-api-client-python.readthedocs.io
   - Adds more python version (3.7 and 3.8) to test matrix and removes 2.6.

1.0.0 Release
   - Major cleanup of API.  
     - Address/port parameters have been replaced with complete 
       endpoints (includes scheme [e.g., http or https]). 
     - ResourceManager has been updated to take a list of endpoints for 
       improved HA support.
     - ResourceManager, ApplicationMaster, HistoryServer and NodeManager
       have been updated with methods corresponding to the latest REST API.
   - pytest support on Windows has been provided.
   - Documentation has been updated.

   **NOTE:** Applications using APIs relative to releases prior to 1.0 should
   pin their dependency on yarn-api-client to _less than_ 1.0 and are encouraged
   to update to 1.0 as soon as possible.

0.3.7 Release  
   - Honor configured HTTP Policy when no address is provided - enabling 
     using of HTTPS in these cases.

0.3.6 Release  
   - Extend ResourceManager to allow applications to determine
     resource availability prior to submission.

0.3.5 Release  
   - Hotfix release to fix internal signature mismatch

0.3.4 Release  
   - More flexible support for discovering Hadoop configuration
     including multiple Resource Managers when HA is configured
   - Properly support YARN post response codes

0.3.3 Release  
   - Properly set Content-Type in PUT requests
   - Check for HADOOP_CONF_DIR env variable

0.3.2 Release  
   - Make Kerberos/SPNEGO dependency optional

0.3.1 Release  
   - Fix cluster_application_kill API

0.3.0 Release  
   - Add support for YARN endpoints protected by Kerberos/SPNEGO
   - Moved to `requests` package for REST API invocation
   - Remove `http_con` property, as connections are now managed by `requests` package

0.2.5 Release  
  - Fixed History REST API

0.2.4 Release  
  - Added compatibility with HA enabled Resource Manager
